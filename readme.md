# Hi there, I'm Kshitiz Wagle 👋

> Backend developer who builds systems that are reliable, scalable, and a little fun to work on.

I spend my time designing APIs, shaping infrastructure, and automating the boring parts. My code is clean, maintainable, and rarely surprises you at 3 AM (unless I've left a sarcastic comment 😄).

## 🚀 What I Do

I focus on making complex systems feel simple - from scalable services to smooth data workflows and architectures that handle real-world load. Good engineering, to me, is equal parts precision, creativity, and wit.

**Recently:**
- 🔄 Merged multiple microservices into a single monorepo 
- 📡 Introduced async messaging to make services communicate cleanly at scale
- 🤖 Built automation tools from AWS Lambda functions to CI/CD pipelines
- ⚡ Reduced manual effort and improved team productivity through smart tooling

## 🎯 Philosophy

- **Curious and eager to learn** - I don't shy away from exploring new tools, technologies, or approaches
- **Push beyond comfort zones** - Always looking to expand beyond familiar territory
- **Bend tools to fit problems** - Love exploring the edges of what's possible
- **Turn debugging nightmares into one-liner jokes** - Because humor makes everything better
